"Source: Death data provided by the National Vital Statistics System public use data file.  Death rates calculated by the National Cancer Institute using SEER*Stat. Death rates are age-adjusted  to the 2000 US standard population [http://seer.cancer.gov/stdpopulations/stdpop.19ages.html] (19 age groups: <1, 1-4, 5-9, ... , 80-84, 85+). The Healthy People 2020 goals are based on rates adjusted using different methods but the differences should be minimal. Population counts for denominators are based on Census populations as modified by NCI."" The 1969-2014 US Population Data File [http://seer.cancer.gov/popdata/] is used with mortality data.
